# Low Voltage Low Power Sub-threshold Operational Amplifier

This project presents a two-stage operational amplifier (Op-Amp) designed for biomedical applications. In the Op-Amp design, all transistors are operated in the sub-threshold region to achieve low-voltage, low-power operation. 

The proposed Op-Amp is based on the **gpdk 180nm** process and is simulated using the **Cadence Virtuoso Analog Design Environment**. The circuit achieves a gain of **43 dB** while consuming a total power of just **111.5 nW** from a **0.8V battery**.

## Key Features
- **Process Technology**: GPDK 180nm
- **Gain**: 43 dB
- **Power Consumption**: 111.5 nW
- **Supply Voltage**: 0.8V
- **Design Environment**: Cadence Virtuoso

This low-power, high-gain amplifier is tailored for applications requiring low energy consumption, such as biomedical devices.
